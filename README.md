# HonorRoll

## Positive Stat Changes
Im creating a mod called HonorRoll, if you get above an 80% on the total of 3 days of scrap it can either.. reduce quota by 5-15% OR raise purchase prices (like what the tentical freak buys products for) by 10-15% OR add an extra day to the collection quota.

## Negative Stat Changes
I think it would also be fun to create an inverse HonorRoll (Remediation) where if you get below a 45% on 3 rounds in a row then store items will raise in price by 5-10%, or buy rates will go down by 15% (tentical thing) or your next quota will be 10-15% higher.
